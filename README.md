# Iris-Dataset-Model
This repository contains the various ML model that has been trained on the Iris Dataset which is a built-in dataset of Sklearn Library

Note: The results / scores of all the models are same and yield to 100% accuracy  which is highly suspicious.
But after changing the parameters, it shows a clear evidence that the dataset contains less samples to train and test on and also the data-points are too clustured, making it an easier data to work on.
